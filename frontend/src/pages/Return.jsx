              <h4>Warranty Claim Procedure –</h4>
              <p>In the unlikely event of a Head/Block/Transmission being defective, we will require the following to be emailed only to us: (ATTN: Claims or Queries emailed to <a href="mailto:sales@fnpautoparts.com">sales@fnpautoparts.com</a>)</p>
              <p>FNP AutoParts provides only a standard replacement warranty of 30 days only on the used parts.</p>
              <p>To activate the warranty, please provide the copy of the Driver's License or any State ID (Photo ID).</p>
              <p>We will require a detailed diagnostic report along with pictures & videos of the described defective part from a Certified Mechanic only.</p>
              <p>A copy of the mechanic’s certification along with their contact information must be provided. We will contact the Certified Mechanic to ensure that the documents are legitimate; the Certified Mechanic may not be the individual who bought the engine from us.</p>
              <p>Once required paperwork will be emailed to us, we will decide on whether we will provide a refund for the damaged engine/transmission to be returned for a replacement.</p>
              <p>The accessories are also not covered under the warranty either they are damaged or missing.</p>
              <p>Shipping charges are also not covered under warranty. You must return the defective part (engine/transmission) completely as received with no parts missing on your cost.</p>
              <p>Make sure all fluids are drained before return.</p>
              <p>If core returns then core also needs to be completely drained. If not then it will result in a $100.00 fee against the core deposit.</p>

              <p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding the warranty or any other type of queries, feel free to contact us via email at <a href="mailto:sales@fnpautoparts.com">sales@fnpautoparts.com</a> or can call us at +1-(888) 807-9696</p>
